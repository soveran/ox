This is a skeleton for a Cuba-based JSON API.

## Getting started

Make sure Redis is installed.

    # Clone this repository:
    $ git clone git@github.com:soveran/ox.git

    # Go to the app's directory:
    $ cd ox

All the commands are run with `make`, and the guide
provides a step by step example of how to get started
and how to interact with your application.
