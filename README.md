# ox

Skeleton for a Cuba-based JSON API.

## Description

Cuba is a microframework for web development, and
this template provides a starting point for building
an application with a JSON API.

The sample application uses Redis as the main database,
and the documentation will guide you on how to use the `Ox`
helper to interact with your application in a very simple
way, both for development and testing.

## Getting started

Make sure Redis is installed.

    # Clone this repository:
    $ git clone git@github.com:soveran/ox.git

    # Go to the app's directory:
    $ cd ox

    # Read the documentation
    $ make help

All the commands are run with `make`, and the guide
provides a step by step example of how to get started
and how to interact with your application.

## Removing the application

All the dependencies will be installed in your project
directory, so if you want to get rid of it you can
just remove that directory. There will be absolutely
no leftovers.
